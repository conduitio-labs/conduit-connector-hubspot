| T3206806 | Check that the "snapshot" key isn't necessary and the user can create the HubSpot source connector without (or an empty) this key (By default is true -> data that was added before starting the pipeline will be transferred)                             | Passed |         |
| T3206807 | The user can't create the HubSpot source connector with an invalid value in the "snapshot" key (for example enter any text or digits, except for valid values) -> the system returns an error                                                              | Passed |         |
| T3206808 | The user can create the HubSpot source connector with a valid value in the "snapshot" key ("1", "t", "T", "true", "TRUE", "True") -> data that was added before starting the pipeline will be transferred                                                  | Passed |         |
| T3206809 | Create the HubSpot source with "snapshot":"false" ("also 0", "f", "F", "false", "FALSE", "False")-> data that was added before starting the pipeline will not be transferred (if add data during the pause, data will be transferred after restarting)     | Passed |         |
